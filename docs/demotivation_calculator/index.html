<h1>The Demotivation Calculator</h1>

<p><i>&ldquo;Do you need more salt in your diet?&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>This page can be used to calculate some fun data about the raise you got (or didn't get) this year.</p>

<p class="notice">The data entered on this page is not saved in any way, shape or form. All calculations are made in your browser.</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>Previous annual salary: <input id="salary" size=10 onkeyup="update();">
<br><span style="font-size:70%">This is your pre-tax salary from last year, excluding things like bonuses and stock grants.</span>
</p>

<p>Non-proportional benefits: <input id="benefits" size=10 onkeyup="update();" value="0">
<br><span style="font-size:70%">This is non-proportional benefits such as bonuses and stock grants. This field is specifically for benefits that are <i>not</i> offered as a percentage of your base salary (because benefits that are a percentage of your base salary would go up proportionally with your raise).</span>
</p>

<p>Raise amount: <input id="raise" size=10 onkeyup="update();">
<br><span style="font-size:70%">This is the amount that you got on your raise this year, in dollars. Can be negative, but hopefully isn't.</span>
</p>

<!-- The inflation rate is the average inflation rate from Dec 2022 to Nov 2023 -->
<p>Inflation rate: <input id="inflation" size=5 onkeyup="update();" value="4.14">
<br><span style="font-size:70%">This is the inflation rate for the previous year. The prepopulated value is the average of the Canadian CPI from December 2022 to November 2023.</span>
</p>

<p>Work hours per week: <input id="hoursPerWeek" size=5 onkeyup="update();" value="37.5">
<br><span style="font-size:70%">Enter the number of hours you <i>actually</i> work in a week. Zoning out at your desk does count.</span>
</p>

    <p>Enter values in all fields to continue.</p>
